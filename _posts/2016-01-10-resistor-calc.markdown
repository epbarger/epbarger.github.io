Just for the record, the phrase *'resistor calculator'* doesn't make much sense to me. It's really an encoder/decoder, not a calculator. However it seems like most people call this sort of tool a calculator so I'll stick with that. I'm probably wrong anyway.

[ResistorCalc.net](http://www.resistorcalc.net) is a simple tool that converts between four-band resistor color codes and their value. The page is written in Javascript, with a little jQuery for DOM manipulation. It also works quite well on phones thanks to the powers of everyone's favorite responsive CSS framework.

I intend to add a few more features to the page in the future, but for now it's complete and useful for hobbyists / EE students.
