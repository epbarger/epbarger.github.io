Last weekend I participated in [Ludum Dare 46](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46) competition, an online game jam held 2 times a year, in which the goal is to build a game solo in 48 hours. Each event has a theme that that your game is supposed to adhere to. For Ludum Dare 46, that theme was "keep it alive".

I strayed from my usual game jam strategy this time around, opting to use [Love2D](https://love2d.org/) instead of [Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php). On top of Love2D, I built a simple old school voxel engine using guidance from [this article](https://github.com/s-macke/VoxelSpace). This was my first time working on a 3D game!

In the game, you defend your campfire from endless waves of corrupted ice monsters. To accomplish this, you fly around with a jetpack, and smack the monsters with your torch. There is a basic combo scoring system built in, which encourages you to occasionally stray from your fire to keep your combo going.

Feedback has been mostly positive so far, so I may update this game in the future!
