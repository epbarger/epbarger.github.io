This is a work in progress. I'll update this post with more details as I continue the project!

Recently, when I was clearing out some old things from my parent's house, I came across my old Sony PSP. I have a lot of fond memories play games like Patapon 2, Wipeout, and Metal Gear Solid on the thing, so I thought it would be fun to revisit some of those games. Problem is, I'd rather play them on a TV! While the PSP 2000 I have supports video out, there is no way to use a real controller, so you're stuck with the built-in tiny joystick. Unless... I could create an adapter to enable me to use a Playstation 2 controller!
