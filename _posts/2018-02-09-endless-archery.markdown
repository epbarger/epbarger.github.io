[Endless Archery](https://epbarger.itch.io/endless-archery) is an arcade game I wrote for the [Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) fantasy console. Check it out on [itch.io](https://epbarger.itch.io/endless-archery)!

The game is simple - fire arrows at targets, on randomly generated terrain. Hit the target, and the terrain scrolls the reveal the next one. I made use of the same midpoint-displacement algorithm I learned working on my [javascript terrain generator demo](/javascript/2018/01/15/terrain-generator-demo.html).

Pico-8 constrains the programming environment in a way I find enjoyable. You get a 128 by 128 pixel screen, a 16 color pallete, and a 8k "token" limit. This strongly encourages you to write smaller scale games, which I appreciate.

I'll probably make more Pico-8 games in the future!
